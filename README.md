# RR Productions

RR Productions is a music production website being built for a client that serves as a platform for them to sell their music. In the near future they will also be producing albums and singles for those interested. 
Features include a view counter that sets an item in local storage, and checks if such item exists to prevent a refresh from incrementing the value, an event subscription that logs emails to the database and sends a message to those on the list each time there is a new event, 
and an admin page, authenticated with Passport, that allows the client to update the music and event page.
Built with React, Express, MongoDB, Paypal Payments API, and Passport.
